# Model Framework for Trust-Driven Cooperation and Social Capital Distribution

This model intends to reproduce the social structure observed in Migliano et al. (2017) and Musciotto et al. (2023). The starting point is the experimental paper Poncela-Casasnovas et al. (2016), where subjects had to interact randomly with other people through different games, and four key heuristics governing their behavior were found. Those experiments were carried out in a well-mixed population context, meaning that every subject could interact with every other one with equal probability. This model brings the network
formation problem into that context. The other ingredient of the model is the limited capability to keep personal relationships, akin to the notion of Dunbarâ€™s number as discussed in Tamarit et al. (2018). There is a maximum number of relationships one can have that depends on how much effort/trust/time/cognitive capability is devoted to each of them.

# How run a simulation

- Enter parameters of the simulation in the `parameters.yaml` file.
- All is then taken care of by the `Network` object defined in the `graph.py` file

Launching a simulation:
```py
from graph import Network
from utils import parse_parameters

yaml_file = r"<path to yaml file>"
out_dir = r"<path to out directory>"

parameters = parse_parameters(yaml_file) # Load parameters from the file
net = Network(parameters, out_dir) # Define the Network object
net.play() # Run the simulation
```

# How to analyze a simulation

In the directory where the simulation is saved you will find 3 differents files:
- `parameters.yaml`: a copy of the parameters used for the simulation
- `init.h5`: a HDF5 file storing the initial adjacency matrix for both trust and link
  - trust network in dataset `"Trust"`
  - link network in dataset `"Link"`
- `stack.csv`: historic of all updates of the network for each interaction
  - Format: |Interaction Number|Operation name|i|j|value|

State of the network for different number of interaction

```py
from operation import OperationStack

out_dir = r"<path to out directory>" # Where the simulation is saved

oper = OperationStack(out_dir)
trust_adjacency_matrix, link_adjacency_matrix = oper.resolve(i) # Return the state of the network at the i-th interaction
final_trust_adjacency_matrix, final_link_adjacency_matrix = oper.resolve(-1) # Equivalent to `oper.resolve(oper.iter_number)`
```
